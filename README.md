# Cleaning and wrangling data with Pandas and Jupyter Notebook at CIJ summer School 2018 

In this series of classes we're going to get you started with python so you can analyse your own data at home. 

### Our Data

We are going to be digging deep into political donations data from the electoral commission. We are looking at all donations between 2015 to date. Like all public data it's messy so there will be plenty of cleaning to do!

You can go back further by searching the database http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/?currentPage=0&rows=10&sort=AcceptedDate&order=desc&tab=1&et=pp&et=ppm&et=tp&et=perpar&et=rd&isIrishSourceYes=true&isIrishSourceNo=true&prePoll=false&postPoll=true&register=gb&register=ni&register=none&optCols=Register&optCols=CampaigningName&optCols=AccountingUnitsAsCentralParty&optCols=IsSponsorship&optCols=IsIrishSource&optCols=RegulatedDoneeType&optCols=CompanyRegistrationNumber&optCols=Postcode&optCols=NatureOfDonation&optCols=PurposeOfVisit&optCols=DonationAction&optCols=ReportedDate&optCols=IsReportedPrePoll&optCols=ReportingPeriodName&optCols=IsBequest&optCols=IsAggregation

## Class 1
In the first class we're going to learn how to read in a csv file, create a dataframe, identify different ways it may be dirty and learn some techniques for cleaning up our data set.

The raw data is called results and should be in a file on your desktop

We will be using the Data cleaning with Pandas-workbook to start with - a complete version is in the repo in case you get into trouble

## Class 2
In the later class we're going to be reading in our new clean data file, interrogating our data and visualising our results
